	<h1>Sports Interests</h1>
	<!-- THIS IS A COMMENT :) -->
	<p>I noticed a lot of UX Designers include an about page on their portfolios to try and provide a sense of the personality they can bring to the workplace. In following that trend, I've created my own about page with some of my favorite sports teams and personalities. While these may not directly relate to UX at all, future iterations of this page will try to make these interests more personal than factual.</p>

		<p>Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton MBE is a British racing driver who races in Formula One for Mercedes AMG Petronas. A four-time Formula One World Champion, he is often considered the best driver of his generation and widely regarded as one of the greatest drivers in the history of the sport. He is also a huge inspiration outside of racing, with his exploits in fashion and efforts to reduce the impacts of global warming.</p>
