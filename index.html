		<h3>Hey there!</h3>
		<p>I'm a junior at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, majoring in Communication Science with certificates in Digital Studies and Computer Science. After discovering my interest for user-centered design and interning with the product team at a fintech startup in my hometown -  Bangalore - this summer, I decided to pursue a career in digital branding and user experience.</p>
		<p>My interest in UX led me to seek out this class - LIS 341 - as I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of information architecture and web design. Using the HTML, CSS and Java knowledge I gain through this course, I will be actively trying to improve this practice personal website until it is up to the standard of modern web design. Check back later to see if I've made any progress! Once I've got the skills to design interactive websites, I intend to design my own portfolio site to host my projects.</p>
